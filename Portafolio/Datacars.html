      <h1>Data Horizon Wheels</h1>
      <p>To begin with we looked for a database that related to the topic of automobiles, the database was taken from the Kaggel page.</p>
    </div>

    <div  class="informacion">
      <p>When reviewing the Excel data I could see that the data was poorly structured, therefore, I made some arrangements within the file and then went on to perform an <span>ETL in the Alteryx program.</span></p>
      <p>In the first part is the Initial Data where we place directly the Excel file, I placed a Select to identify the variables that interest me and what format they have, we continue with the creation of two formulas.</p>
      <p>In the <span>first formula</span> what is planned is to see the <span>price of cars in 4 other countries</span> which are: Colombia, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, each with a corresponding TRM.</p>
      <p>In the <span>second formula</span> what was done is to <span>create the variable Country</span> as it is a fundamental variable to identify the country of the company, with that you could make a comparison between companies in the same country and number of companies per country.</p>
      <p>Finally I have a part of Check Point to be able to check if the formulas were well and the Data Dashboard which is the data that will be saved to go directly to a visualization tool such as Tableau, Power BI, Data Studio or Qlik Sense.</p>

      <h2>Creation of Dashboard</h2>
      <p>It is good to make a recognition of the variables that compose the data that will be used for the dashboards:</p>

  <section class="dashboard">

    </div>
  </section>
  <div class="filter">
    <p>
      <span>The country</span> of reference of each car <span> did not appear in the original database</span>, therefore, it was necessary to 
      investigate and <span>create the variable "Country"</span> with the corresponding country of each car, with this it was possible 
      to create a filter by country.
    </p>
    <p>Continuing we <span>created a parameter</span> with the name <span>"Type Currency"</span> where we placed the <span>different corresponding 
      currencies</span> such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and the United States, so that the user can visualize the price that 
      best suits him/her.
